iGutschke
=========

iGutschke home page, populated from RSS feeds.
Adjust info.json and igutschke-proxy.conf to customize the home page.
The latter should be copied to /etc.

Configure Nginx to load igutschke.nginx at startup. You also need to
add a few lines to the global configuration for Nginx (see the top of
igutschke.nginx for what needs to be added).
